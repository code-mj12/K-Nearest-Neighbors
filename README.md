# K-Nearest-Neighbors
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs) is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm widely used for classification and regression tasks. It identifies the K nearest data points to a given input and uses them to make predictions based on the majority of their class or the average of their values. This code is an implementation of KNN on diabetes data. It predicts whether a person has diabetes based on a range of features
